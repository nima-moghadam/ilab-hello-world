        "# Summary\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates InstructLab, an open source AI project that facilitates knowledge and skills contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructLab uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081). The open source InstructLab repository is available [here](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) and provides additional documentation on using InstructLab.\n",
        "\n",
        "The InstructLab method consists of three major components:\n",
        "* **Taxonomy-driven data curation:**  The taxonomy is a set of training data curated by humans as examples of new knowledge and skills for the model.\n",
        "* **Large-scale synthetic data generation:** A teacher model is used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Since synthetic data can vary in quality, InstructLab adds an automated step to refine the example answers, ensuring they are grounded and safe.\n",
        "* **Iterative model alignment tuning:** The model is retrained based on the synthetic data. The InstructLab method includes two tuning phases: knowledge tuning, followed by skill tuning.\n",
